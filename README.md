# GoLocalChromeFramework

This framework uses Chrome (Windows) or Chromium (Linux) as frontend by opening them with cmd/terminal and hosting a localhost webserver, while opening chrome/chromium with --app and --user-directory arguments. The frontend can be changed by the user in runtime, while the backend needs to be compiled/build. The API can be decoupled in future versions, so every part of the application is changeable - Sustainable development. Frontends is easy to change. Alternatives to this is embedding a chromium or webview framework into the project, which will require more space. I chose to depend on Chrome/Chromium, as they are market leaders and html/css/javascript technology frontrunners.
